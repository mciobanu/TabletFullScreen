# Tablet Full Screen

This is a Firefox add-on to make it easier to use tablets with the browser in full-screen mode

It adds three on-screen buttons: **Close**, **Back**, and **Full-Screen**. 

The big thing is that you now have an easy way to close tabs and to toggle between full-screen and normal view even if the
toolbar or address bar aren't visible and you don't have a keyboard or it isn't connected. These buttons are shown on all
web pages, and try to be quite non-obtrusive (but may not always succeed.)

Another thing that can be annoying is that it may take a while for the buttons to show up, and sometimes they may not show 
up at all or may be hidden by other UI elements. And there's at least a site where the icons are not shown (though the 
buttons still work.)  

Although it seems to make sense to allow some customization (button color, size, placement), there is currently no support
for customizations, but it may be added if there's a real need.

### Installation
Download the sources, go to **about:debugging** in Firefox, enable add-on debugging, click on **Load Temporary Add-on**,
pick a file from the project (e.g. the manifest.) Now the add-on should be installed and non-Mozilla sites should have 
the 3 buttons in the upper-right corner.
